# URI CSC212 Final Project: Sorting Algorithms
By Claudia Deverdits, Jessica Tingley, Samuel Calise

# Summary
This repository holds the source code for our final project, the implementation of insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, and parallel insertion sort. 

# Compilation Instructions
The source code is written in C++ and can be compiled in an IDE using the “g++” compiler. You will need the following files:

* main.cpp
* merge_sort.cpp
* merge_sort.h
* quick_sort.cpp
* quick_sort.h
* insertion_sort.cpp
* insertion_sort.h
* parallel_insertion_sort.cpp
* parallel_insertion_sort.h

Once these files are in the same folder, you can access the folder using cd folder_name. You can use the following line in the terminal to compile the program:

```
g++ main.cpp merge_sort.cpp insertion_sort.cpp quick_sort.cpp -o prog
```

# Runtime Instructions
To run the code, enter the following line into your terminal after compiling: 

```
./prog
```
